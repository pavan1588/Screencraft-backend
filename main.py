    grammar = "Its cinematic rhythm is restrained. Visual cuts are implied but not rushed. Transitions are emotional rather than spatial."

    genre = "This qualifies as a grounded family drama — avoiding melodrama, it builds tension through behavior, not events."

    realism = "Characters act out of emotional realism. Their avoidance, pauses, and half-lines speak volumes without telling."

    visuals = "Space is used symbolically — distance at the table, a chipped object, side-light — all subtly convey relationship strain."

    sound = "The ambient ticking and silence do emotional work. The lack of score supports realism and tension."

    editing = "Editing feels invisible. Time expands between lines, leaving silence to fill the emotional gaps."

        "You could let Kabir almost leave but pause at the door. This non-verbal tension adds dimensionality. Or let Anaya glance at a specific object before saying 'I’m trying' — it layers her emotion. These beats add memory and texture without needing dialogue."
